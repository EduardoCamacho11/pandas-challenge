# pandas-challenge

When I began working on this challenged i used the templed provided by the professor to import and create the data path and to read the files. 
I used the formulas provided by the templeted throughout my work.
I worked independiatly through the District Summary.
In the school summary section i used helped from Xpert Learning Assitance to get ideas to develop the formulat i used for this section. 
During office hours i received help from the TA (Kenny) to trouble shot trhough a problem i had with my second data frame. This helped assisted me wiht continuing trouble shooting with other dataframes.
I also used Xpert Learning Assitance to get ideas on how to create the formula studnent passing math. 
For the rest of the challenge i used the formulas included in the templet and also used ideas from the past formulas i used throughout the challenge.


Analysis:
The data gathered in this analysis was based on student grades and school spending in an entire school district.
The data compares budgets in charter schools and district schools and grades in reading and math for all the students in 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th grade.
Based on the data gathered, charter schools and disctrict schools have similar budget per school and per students. Based on this information, budget does not impact better performance in schools.
Charter schools have the 5 highest-performing school base on overall passing percentages.
District schools have the 5 lowest-performing school base on overall passing percentages. 
Based on over all data, Charter schools have better average math and reading scores as well as overall passing percentage for math and reading.
